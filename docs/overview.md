**Project Overview**

This project is a *Portfolio Website* created as part of the *Computer Science Fundamentals and Career Pathways (CSFCP)* assignment.  

The main goal of this assignment is to demonstrate the *use of version control tools like Git and GitHub* while developing a small software project.  

Key points about this project:

- The portfolio website is *static, built using **HTML and CSS*.  
- The project shows my personal information, skills, projects, and contact details.  
- *Version control workflow* was followed:
  - Initializing a Git repository with git init  
  - Staging changes using git add  
  - Committing changes using git commit with meaningful messages  
  - Pushing the project to GitHub using git push  
- The project helped me understand *branching, committing, and collaborative workflows* on GitHub.  

This overview summarizes how the portfolio project integrates both *web development skills* and *fundamental Git/GitHub practices*, preparing me for professional software development workflows.
