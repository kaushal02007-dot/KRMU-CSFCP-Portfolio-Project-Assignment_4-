**# Development Process**

This portfolio project was developed following the standard *Git and GitHub workflow*. The steps are described below:

1. **Project Setup**
   - Created a project folder on my computer for the portfolio.  
   - Opened the folder in *Visual Studio Code*.  
   - Initialized a Git repository using:
     
     git init
     

2. **Creating Files**
   - Developed index.html for the structure of the website.  
   - Created style.css for styling.  
   - Added an images/ folder for screenshots and other graphics.  

3. **Version Control with Git**
   - Added files to Git staging area:
     
     git add .
     
   - Made meaningful commits with messages like:
     
     git commit -m "Initial commit - added HTML, CSS, and images"
     
   - Continued making changes and committing them after every update (total 5 commits).  

4. **Connecting to GitHub**
   - Created a new repository on GitHub.  
   - Connected local repository to GitHub:
     
     git remote add origin <repo-url>
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main
     

5. **Adding Documentation**
   - Created README.md describing the project.  
   - Created docs/ folder with:
     - overview.md  
     - development_process.md  
     - future_improvements.md  

6. **Final Push**
   - Pushed all files including the docs folder to GitHub:
     
     git add .
     git commit -m "Added docs and README"
     git push
     

**Outcome:**  
By following this process, I learned to properly use *Git commands, maintain commits, and host a project on **GitHub*, while building a complete portfolio website.
